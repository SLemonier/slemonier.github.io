Hi!

My name is Steven, and I am currently a System Engineer, specialized in Citrix Technologies. I am a CCE-V for now 4 years, and I like to spend a lot of time working on ADC/ADM as well as on automation.

I am a co-Leader for the Swiss CUGC for about a year now.

I was recently introduced as a Citrix Technology Advocate (CTA)!

I have 10 years’ experience with Citrix, which sounds not that much in comparison with my fellow specialists, but I always think we can learn from anyone, either he is a newbie in IT or a worldwide class expert. And as knowledge is power, I wish everyone to share as much as possible!

Strong people don’t put others down… They lift them up!
